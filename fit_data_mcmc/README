This folder contains the code used to fit small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data of dilute suspensions of colloidal PbS nanocrystals.

The files included are:
  fit_data_mcmc.m - Main MATLAB script run to fit the data and process the output.
  define_model.m - Function which contains the model definition.
  int_lin_profile.m - Function to integrate a linear profile in spherical coordinates.
  plot_MCMC_output.m - Function which plots the output of the data fitting.
  gwmcmc.m - Markov chain Monte Carlo script from Aslak Grinsted https://github.com/grinsted/gwmcmc
  GaussHermite.m - Function to return the nodes and weights for implementing instrument smearing via Gauss Hermite quadrature.
  makelogprior.m - Function to return the log-prior function including lower/upper bounds and any constraints.
  get_restart_walkers.m - Function to take a subset of the parameters from the initial MCMC run for initializing the production run.
  calc_atomic_ratios.m - Function which takes the fit volume fraction profiles and translates that to experimental measureables.
  parameter_statistics.m - Function to compute statistics on the fit parameters.
  cornerplot.m - Function to plot the corner plot showing marginal and pairwise distributions for the fit parameters.
  sans_data.mat - SANS data formatted for input to the fit_data_mcmc script.
